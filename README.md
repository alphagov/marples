# Marples

A message destination arbiter.

  "Alfred Ernest Marples, Baron Marples PC (9 December 1907 â€“ 6 July 1978) was
  a British Conservative politician who served as Postmaster General and
  Minister of Transport. Following his retirement from active politics in 1974,
  Marples was elevated to the peerage."

As Postmaster, Ernest Marples introduced postcodes to the UK, making message
routing easier.

Marples, this gem, removes any uncertainty about which destination our messages
go to by enforcing a naming scheme.
